<h4>How does Active Record use an SQL sequence object for the ID field?</h4>

  Rails <strong>somehow</strong> generates a table with the id field as a sequential integer. This is a surrogate key.
  NEXTVAL is a function to get the next value from a sequence.

  Sequence is an object which returns ever-increasing numbers, different for each call, regardless of transactions etc.

  Each time you call NEXTVAL, you get a different number.
