Q2)
In our view we used the following line to implement the dropdown of the existing category.
<%= form.select :category, Quotation.pluck(:category).uniq, include_blank: true %>

New category was possible only with form_with as it allows new fields other than corresponding fields in our model to be used. We passed the new_category in the params from view to controller and used it to create new quotation whenever it was supplied. Otherwise, we just chose the one provided by the dropdown.

Q3)
We made our search case insensitive by using the following line of code:
@quotations = Quotation.where("lower(quote) like ? OR lower(author_name) like ?", search_term.downcase, search_term.downcase).where.not(id: killed_ids)


Q4)




Q5)
We used the send_data method to export the file to the client's computer

Q6)
First we wrote the file in public folder of Rails.root. And then parsed the xml elements using Nokogiri. Then, we created new Quotations for each dataset of xml.
